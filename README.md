# Snake-And-Ladders
## A simple game with no GUI

> Design and implement a Snakes and Ladders game in Python.

>> There are 6 face dice which are being rolled by the player to their chance.

>> The player starts from 0 and has to reach the final position (in our case,it's 100).

>> There are some ladders which turn out to be lucky for the player as they shorten the way.

>> There are some snakes present in between the game which turns out to be the enemy of the player as they just lengthen their way to 100.

>> The position of snakes and ladders are stored in start:end format where start denotes the position of ladder/snake and end denotes the value that it reaches.

>> ● The game will only be **text output** based, i.e. no GUI will be shown to the user. Instead, it will use print statements to display the position of a
     particular player, end results etc.

>> ● There are only **2 players** in the game and no spectators are allowed.

>> ● The first thing that the game will ask to input will be names of the players.

>> ● The input should first ask the name of Player 1 and then after giving input, it should ask the name of Player 2.

>> ● For a particular player’s chance, it will ask to input his/her chance. If Player 1 enters “ ​ **roll** ​ ” (excluding quotes), then a random number will be
generated between ​ **1 and 6 ( ​ both inclusive)**.

>> ● The output will be shown and then the ​ **final position will be displayed each time a player plays**​ his/her chance.

>> The game consists of 2 modes: ​ **Auto mode and manual mode**​ . For auto mode, a player will type ​ **roll** ​ and a random number will be generated imitating the roll of dice. For a manual mode, instead of entering roll,players can enter ​ **any number between 1 and 20** ​ and that particular number will imitate that throw.
